todo list

map? 

actual death? --meh, can be added when menus?

pseudosocket? 

Begin creating testable rules, preferably with more robust mechanics than "don't jump"

Also, create some sort of function giving flavortext when a rule is put in place. 

known bugs

something causes the characters to flash- has this been fixed?
